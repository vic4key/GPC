# [GPC â€“ General Polygon Clipper](http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~toby/gpc/)

The University of Manchester GPC library (wikipedia: [GPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Polygon_Clipper)) is a flexible and highly robust polygon set operations library for use with C, C#, Delphi, Java, Perl, Python, Haskell, Lua, VB.Net (and other) applications.

**GPC Features**

- Difference, intersection, exclusive-or and union clip operations are supported.
- Polygons may be comprised of multiple disjoint contours.
- Contour vertices may be given in any order - clockwise or anticlockwise.
- Contours may be convex, concave or self-intersecting.
- Contours may be nested (i.e. polygons may have holes).
- Output may take the form of either polygon contours or tristrips.
- Hole and external contours are differentiated in the result.
- Coincident edges and degenerate regions are handled correctly.
